## ðŸ“Š Data Analytics
- **Duration:** 10 weeks
- **About:** In this course, I learned the fundamentals of databases and how to work with relational database systems using SQL. I gained experience designing and developing dashboards in Power BI, applying DAX, M language, and Power Query. By the end of the course, I was able to carry out complete data analytics projects, from gathering requirements to building interactive dashboards.
- **Final Project:** I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze warehouse occupancy and SKU dispersion, integrating SQL Server and Excel data sources.  
  - *Tools:* Power BI, SQL Server, Excel.

## ðŸ“Š Data Science I
- **Duration:** 10 weeks
- **About:** In this course, I discovered the fundamentals of Data Science. I learned how to work with large volumes of data, perform exploratory data analysis, and use Python to solve complex problems. For the final project, I worked on an Australian domestic flight dataset, analyzing passenger trends and building predictive models. I applied data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis. I then developed and evaluated models such as Linear Regression and a Random Regressor to forecast passenger demand. This project allowed me to complete the full data science workflow, from data preparation and exploration to modeling and performance evaluation.
- **Final Project:** I developed predictive models using Linear Regression and a Random Regressor on an Australian domestic flights dataset to forecast passenger demand.
  - *Tools:* Python, Pandas, Nupy, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.
